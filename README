> XV6 repo for Polimi AOS Students 

This repo has been forked from the original Unix V6 port to RISCV. You can
inspect the code, or even run it in an emulator (qemu) in a docker container.

# Build and aunch the container 

Cwd in the `scripts` directory; to build:

```sh
make build
```

this will take time as it has to download all the necessary toolchains. Once build, 
launch the interactive shell:

```sh 
make connect
```

Once in the container, to compile the kernel:

```sh
cd /local && make TOOLPREFIX=/opt/riscv/toolchain/bin/riscv64-unknown-elf-
```

To run it on qemu

``` sh
cd /local && make TOOLPREFIX=/opt/riscv/toolchain/bin/riscv64-unknown-elf- qemu
```


# Original XV6 readme 

```
xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu). The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.S081, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu. Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".
